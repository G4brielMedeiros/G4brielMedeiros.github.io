	<h2><a name=GBA></a>Game Boy Advance SP</h2>
	<p>The good old Nintendo from a simpler time...</p> 
	<img title="Red GBA SP" src="images/links/gba.jpg" height="250"/>
	<p>I had this one years ago, I don't even remember what I played on it.<br/>
	   I do remember having to give it to my cousin when I got the PSVITA, and he broke it.<br/>
	   I will <strong>never</strong> forgive him. He also broke my PS2.

	<h2><a name=VTA></a>PlayStation Vita</h2>
	<p>Underated gem of a hardware that got abandoned by Sony and everyone.</p>

	<img src="images/links/vita2.jpg" height="212"/>
	<p>This one is a sad story, the Vita had amazing potential, but barely got<br/>
	   any good games and first-party support. A shame, but the homebrew community<br/>
	   managed to keep it alive with emulator support and amazing plugins, hence why<br/>
	   I hacked it. I also bought the slim version recently since they are going up in prices.

	<h2><a name=NSW></a>Nintendo Switch</h2>
	<p>The Vita done right.</p>
	<img src="images/links/switch.jpg" height="350"/>
	<p>My latest, main console. This is where I play while I don't have a PS5.<br/>
	   It's the perfect portable console that is everything the Vita should've<br/>
	   been, I am glad Nintendo made this, hopefully Sony will <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/69077/playstation-vita-dead-good-sony-make-another-handheld/index.html" title="Sony has no plans of making another handheld">change their mind</a><br/>
	   and make a new Vita, with quality games and support.
