					<h2><big>It's my girlfriend's birthday!</big></h2>
					<p>She's the best. She's a law student, speaks 3 languages, can sing, dance, even play the piano now. I could go on about a thousand reasons to love this girl but then I'll be jealous of whoever's reading :) Happy birthday Leka! There's truly no one like you. &#x2665;</p>

					<h2>Some personal updates</h2>
					<p>I have a new base of operations now. I no longer have to feel stuck in that tiny room, but most importantly, I have a second screen back!</p>
					<img src="images/update/desktop.jpg">
					<p>Also, since we're doing life updates in my little blog, here's an update for my game colection, a New 2DS XL. Now I can play Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask remasters in... uh... 240p. Should I have used an emulator instead? Maybe, but I always wanted a 3DS, and now I got one, and that's awesome too. I just wish they still sold actual 3DS systems so I can see what the 3D effect is like, but since this is the only system still being sold new, I didn't have much of a choice. Plus you can't beat $99!</p>

					<h2><a href="index.html" title="">New Homepage!</a></h2>
					<p>This link literally takes you right back here <em><small>(or to an archive of here.. hm... Hello time traveler!)</small></em> Isn't it great? I feel like this is the best thing I've ever created online, but hopefully I will have even better websites later! :)</p>

					<h2><a href="6javascript.html" title="">JavaScript</a></h2>
					<p>Just a simple calculator to demonstrate a hint of JavaScript. You may have noticed I started using the same CSS file from before. The reason is simply to keep everything on the same theme, I'm sure every web developer does this, right? Well, now that I started HTML5 & CSS3, I have a new CSS file to use from now on, that is much much much better.</p>

					<h2><a href="oldindex.html" title="">CSS for Homepage</a></h2>
					<p>So... this was supposed to be the one where I add CSS to the homepage. But I already did this before, so... I will just link you to the same thing.</p>

					<h2><a href="5forms.html" title="">Forms</a></h2>
					<p>Just a big form with multiple inputs that lead nowhere. I think it looks great, but there's no JavaScript, so it doesn't really work. Maybe one day it will?</p>

					<h2><a href="4tables.html" title="">Tables</a></h2>
					<p>Table. Just a big, simple table, with made up stats. I stole the names from my favorite cartoon, and used CSS and HTML to make a cool table.</p>

					<h2><a href="oldindex.html" title="">First Welcome Page</a></h2>
					<p>Now it gets interesting. I finally started using CSS, so I can actually center stuff, use good fonts, sizes, etc. I used this website as my hub up until this new one launched. (as I am typing, it hasn't yet!)</p>

					<h2><a href="3links.html" title="">Links</a></h2>
					<p>Here's where links were introducted, and some other little concepts too. You can see the slight improvement beginning to take form.</p>

					<h2><a href="2favoritefood.html" title="">Favorite Food</a></h2>
					<p>This was when I was learning forms, I think. It's still the boring HTML-only format, but still a step up with picutes and lists.</p>

					<h2><a href="1firstpage.html" title="">My First HTML Page</a></h2>
					<p>This is the first assignment for the class, I though it was okay at the time but it doesb't compare to what I am able to do now. I am still proud of it though, and perhaps someday I will look at this very website and call it ugly, for I will have a new, better website.</p>
