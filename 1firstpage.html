		<p>
			I like games, puzzles, and programming. I have a gaming PC, Nintendo Switch,	 	<br/>
			2 hacked PS Vitas <small>(Yeah I know they're old but they're are special ok shush)	<br/>
			</small> and I plan on buying the PS5 day one! 
		</p>
		<p>	
			I know a lot about programming, been studying for like <em>3 years...</em>	<br/>
			But for now I am only mastering Java. I plan on learning Python and			<br/>
			JavaScript as well, so I can have some more tools in my toolbox.
